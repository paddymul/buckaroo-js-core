## \_

This module contains the standard library from rechart so that base rechart code cna be imported with the minimum amount of rewriting

## AnimationTiming

The type of easing function to use for animations

Type: (`"ease"` | `"ease-in"` | `"ease-out"` | `"ease-in-out"` | `"linear"`)

## AnimationDuration

Specifies the duration of animation, the unit of this option is ms.

Type: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)

## React

Reimplementation of rechart tooltips.  most of this is copied from ??? in the recharts source tree because the parts we are editting are deeply embedded into functions.

Most of the point of this is to get tooltips to be absolutely positioned off of document.body, not the nearest parent element.  AG-Grid hides those tooltips otherwise.

## defaultProps

needs to be set so that renderByOrder can access an have default values for
children.props when there are no props set by the consumer
doesn't work if using default parameters
